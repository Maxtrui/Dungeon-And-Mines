# Dungeon-And-Mines
First project in c of two university students. 

This is our first project, which is based on a simple university assignment. We as a team decided to add a bit of difficulty adding a more attractive menu, functions and headers to make the code simpler to the eye. It took us 3 days to do all this work having only 2 weeks of learning the C language.

@Maxtrui and @Kotonitro
